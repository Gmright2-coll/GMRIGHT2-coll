2020-10-02T21:31:54.7390670Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2020-10-02T21:31:54.7392879Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2020-10-02T21:31:54.7394848Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

2020-10-02T21:31:54.7398554Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2020-10-02T21:31:54.7401091Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2020-10-02T21:31:54.7402974Z 
2020-10-02T21:31:54.7405095Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2020-10-02T21:31:54.7406870Z 
2020-10-02T21:31:54.7408593Z Or undo this operation with:
2020-10-02T21:31:54.7410310Z 
2020-10-02T21:31:54.7412920Z   git switch -
2020-10-02T21:31:54.7416465Z 
2020-10-02T21:31:54.7418283Z Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
